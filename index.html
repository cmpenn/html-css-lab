        Wealth, fame, power. The world had it all won by one man: the Pirate King, Gold Roger. At his death, the words he spoke drove countless men out to sea.
       <div>"My treasure? It's yours if you want it. Find it! I left all the world has there!" </div>
        And so men set sights on the Grand Line, in pursuit of their dreams. The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

<h2>The world of One Piece</h2>
